# Note

In this week, our 'hands-on' were mostly analysing files, which are in the 
tlpi-book.

## Hint: 
Review the 'hands-on' as described in https://github.com/tamberg/fhnw-syspr/blob/master/10/Syspr10PosixIPC.pdf

- Slide 15: Hands-on 'Message Queues'
- Slide 18: Hands-on 'Notifications'
- Slide 27: Hands-on 'Semaphore'
- Slide 40: Hands-on 'Shared Memory'

Don't forget: the tlpi-book and all its example files are installed in this project, see 
`src/andiswiss/tlpi-book/README_AA.md`.
