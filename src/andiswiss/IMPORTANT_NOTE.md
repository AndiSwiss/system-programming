# NOTE for Hands-On: 

I uploaded the stuff for the hands-on in a separate folder
to the syspr classroom.

So, I edited it in here (in CLion - for a better learning experience and fast trying out of new 
code and variants with the great Docker-Setup), but at the end, I copied
all to this local folder and then `git commit ...` and `git push`.


## Location
- For each lesson, there is the online repo:
  - https://github.com/fhnw-syspr-4ibb2/fhnw-syspr-work-01-AndiSwiss   (with continuing numbers)
- locally on my computer in:
  - ~/Documents/FHNW/FHNW 2020 FS/syspr (4Ibb2)/Hands-on-Projekte/fhnw-syspr-work-01-AndiSwiss
