# About

This is the section from me (AndiSwiss - https://github.com/AndiSwiss). I created
this repo to be able to try out stuff and follow along the course 'syspr' at FHNW: https://www.fhnw.ch/de/studium/module/6008081

The slides from professor Thomas Amberg are here: https://github.com/tamberg/fhnw-syspr
My folder-numbering corresponds with those from Th. Amberg


# Getting it to work
-> see README.md in the root of this project. I've provided a `makefile` where possible.
