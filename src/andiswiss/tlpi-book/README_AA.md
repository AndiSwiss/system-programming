# Installation process

I (AndiSwiss) did follow the following steps in order to 
get tlpi-book to work:



```bash
cd src/andiswiss/
apt-get install wget
wget http://man7.org/tlpi/code/download/tlpi-180725-book.tar.gz --no-check-certificate
tar xfzmv tlpi-180725-book.tar.gz
```

With `make`, you should be able to build the project.
